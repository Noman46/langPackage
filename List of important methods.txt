There are severel important method in sting Class which are listed below

1) Public char charAt(int index);
   To find the character in a specific index position

2) public String concat(string s);
   To joint two string

3) public boolean equals( object o);
   As we know string class equals method is overriden o compare content not the reference
 this method compare two string respective to case. So it is a case sensitive method

4) public boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String s);
  It alse compare two string but irrespective of there case. So it is not case sensitive

5)public String substring(int begin);
 It generets a substring of a given strin. Take parameters as int and starts the substring from that position
here one think should be noticed the "S" of substring is not capital.

6) public string substring(int begin, int end)
It works same as substring but it has a bound within which the substring will be generated.

7) public int length();
It provides the total number of character a string has. But point to be noted my lord, there is another same word in java as
length which is used for Array to find the length but length() is a method which is used for only string object.

8) public String replace(char oldch, char new ch);
 It repalces a specific character from a string with a new given character.

9)public String trim();
 Works to vanish all the white spaces infront of String and at the ending. But it does not
work for removing spaces from the middle of any string. For that we have to override the method 

10) public int indexOf(char ch);
 It returns the index number of a given character.

11) oublic String toLowerCase();
 It converts any string to lower case

12) public string touUpperCase();
 it converts any String to upper case.
