1) What is awrapper class?

Wrapper means wrape something with a cover or packet. We have a chocolate and we cover it with a
packet. Now in java we have primtive Data type. But java is purely object oriented language. So we need
to convert those primtive ttype into object type. Wrapper class actualy convert those primtive into object
type.

lete consider the following example.
                   
                    ArrayList l= new ArrayList();
                          l.add(10);
for this compiler will give an error. Because Arraylist is an object but '10' is an primtive. We cant fit
primtive into object.
                  Integer i = new Integer(10);
                          l.add(i);
In this case the code happily compile. Because Integer class convert the integer value 10 into an integer object.

There are 8 wrapper class in java. They are listed below.
                 1)Integer
                 2)Long
                 3)short
		 4)Byte
		 5)Character
                 6)Boolean
                 7)Float
                 8)Double

So the basic purpose of wrapper class is to convert primtive into object type
