Now here I am going to discuss about some the very important constructor that String Class has.

1) String s = new String();
   
      This is an empty String object, which is not containing any value. There is a mis conception 
about String s=""; and String s = null;. The first one is an empty string onject where the object exists.
But the second one is null means there is no String object there. 
To describe emptyness we must have something that can contain.
Like there is a jar but the jar is empty. 
First example reflects this idea where there is an object of string but that object does
not contain anything. But for the second example Even the Jar is unavailable.

2) String s = new String(String literal);
    This is for containing any string value. 

3)string s= new String(StringBuffer sb);
   
    For a given stringBuffer object create an string object. This helps to convert StringBuffer into 
String. Or other waya we can say tgo convert mutability into immutability


4)String s = new String( char [] ch);
  For a given char array to convert into an string object.

5) String s = new String(byte[] b);
  For a given byte array to convert into an string object.
